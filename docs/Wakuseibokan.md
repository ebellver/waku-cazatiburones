Carrier Command was an outstanding and legendary game.  The 3D graphics that the game represented were ahead of its time for the still dawning home computer industry.  This game is inspired in that awesome game.  

This is a port that serves many purposes at the same time:

* Game development platform.
* OpenGL-learning platform.
* Game and Physics engine.
* Physics simulator.
* An airplane simulator.
* A testbed for Artificial Intelligence.
* A testbed for Robotics.
